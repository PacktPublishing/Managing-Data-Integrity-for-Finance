Please examine the contents of these two files and provide information as to their data structure and type of data that they contain.

Please validate the Suburb column in the Sales_Transactions.xlsx file to the NSW_Post_Code.xlsx file. Please identify any suburbs that have mismatches using this column between the two files.

For these mismatched suburbs, find the closest match based on the NSW Post Code.xlsx file based on similarity of spelling. Please list them in a table format for review prior to any updates.

Please update the mismatched suburbs in the Sales_Transactions.xlsx file based on the closest match. Kindly show the transactions in table format when completed.

Please analyze what this file contains and provide information as to the data structure and type of data it has.

Give me a preview of the data in the file.

Please provide the basic statistics such as the number of transactions in the file, as well as the number of unique and distinct transactions for each column.

Please check the Transaction ID column and identify if there are any transactions that are repeated.

Can you show the duplicate rows in the dataset?

Please remove the duplicate rows identified then provide the total distinct and unique transactions for the Transaction ID column.

Please provide the details of the transaction or transactions which do not have a date in the year 2020.

Please update the year to 2020 for the Transaction Date and show the updated fields for this transaction.

Review the Product_ID and Sales_Manager columns to see if there are any unusual values.

Provide the details of the top 10 transactions with the highest quantities.

For Transaction ID 2020644, update the Quantity to 200 and show the updated details.

Export the cleaned data to an Excel file.

Using the original dataset uploaded, create a scatter chart with sum of quantity on the Y-axis and the months on the X-axis.

Using the original dataset, create a histogram using the quantity column with bin size of 1,553.

Under which buckets do our values fall? Include the number of entries to understand the distribution.

Using the cleaned data, create a histogram with a bin size of 100 based on the Quantity column.
